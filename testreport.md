# Test report for math operations module.

## This report shows the result of the manual testing of the modules different math calculations public methods. All test cases is related to arrays of numbers since the modules functionality is entierly focused in that area. The tests has been performed in a "test app" where different types of arrys related to specific methods has been used. The result of the module calculations has been compared to the actual expected values from the different types of calculations performed on the arrays of numbers. The tests also includes testing of validation aiming to ensure the arrays contains at least one number and only numbers and that the input is actual arrays.
